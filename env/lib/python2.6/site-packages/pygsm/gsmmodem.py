class GsmModem(object):
    """pyGSM is a Python module which uses pySerial to provide a nifty
       interface to send and receive SMS via a GSM Modem. It was ported
       from RubyGSM, and provides (almost) all of the same features. It's
       easy to get started:

          # create a GsmModem object:
          >>> import pygsm
          >>> modem = pygsm.GsmModem(port="/dev/ttyUSB0")

          # harass Evan over SMS:
          # (try to do this before 11AM)
          >>> modem.send_sms("+13364130840", "Hey, wake up!")

          # check for incoming SMS:
          >>> print modem.next_message()
          <pygsm.IncomingMessage from +13364130840: "Leave me alone!">


       There are various ways of polling for incoming messages -- a choice
       which has been deliberately left to the application author (unlike
       RubyGSM). Execute `python -m pygsm.gsmmodem` to run this example:

          # connect to the modem
          modem = pygsm.GsmModem(port=sys.argv[1])

          # check for new messages every two
          # seconds for the rest of forever
          while True:
              msg = modem.next_message()

              # we got a message! respond with
              # something useless, as an example
              if msg is not None:
                  msg.respond("Thanks for those %d characters!" %
                      len(msg.text))

              # no messages? wait a couple
              # of seconds and try again
              else: time.sleep(2)
